# traffic_analysis
Our mongodb collection is called bingus bongus. God help us all.

This is a cool ass Traffic Analysis and Road Model generation tool.
You can upload:
i) a single image
ii) dashcam footage
iii) traffic camera footage.
We do traffic analysis using a fine-tuned YOLOv11n model to detect cars, pedestrians, etc. and use the generated data to recreate the scene in Gazebo (3D modelling). 
This is useful not only for lawmakers and roadmakers to understand the ground reality of their roads, but also to get useful 3D simulated data for training FSD models.

Sincerely,
boga
